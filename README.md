                                                                      Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project performs multiclass sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral) on social media text using machine learning.

Project Workflow:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing

2. TF-IDF feature extraction

3. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models

4. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Results:

1. Logistic Regression Accuracy: 63.8%

2. Naive Bayes Accuracy: 62.6%

Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

How to Run:

1. Install dependencies:
2. pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib openpyxl

Run:

python sentiment_analysis.py

Future Improvements:

1. Hyperparameter tuning

2. Adding n-grams

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. Deep Learning models (LSTM)
